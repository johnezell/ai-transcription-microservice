## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## S3 Signed URL Configuration

To improve performance when assets are localized, S3 signed URL generation can be disabled:

### Environment Configuration

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Disable S3 signed URL generation (default: false)
# Set to true only if you need S3 download functionality
TRUEFIRE_S3_ENABLED=false
```

### Performance Impact

- **Disabled (false)**: Pages load faster, no S3 API calls
- **Enabled (true)**: Generates S3 signed URLs for all segments (slower loading)

When `TRUEFIRE_S3_ENABLED=false`, the `/truefire-courses/{id}` page will skip S3 signed URL generation, significantly improving load times since assets are now localized.
