The instructor provides detailed explanations of guitar techniques, music theory concepts, chord progressions, scale patterns, fingerpicking and strumming techniques, musical terminology, and educational guidance.

Examples: C major chord, D minor chord, E dominant 7 chord, F sharp diminished chord, G suspended 4 chord, A minor 7 flat 5 chord, B flat major 9 chord. Musical notes with proper spelling: A, B, C, D, E, F, G with accidentals - C# (C sharp not \"see sharp\"), Db (D flat not \"the flat\"), F# (F sharp), Bb (B flat), Ab (A flat), Eb (E flat), G# (G sharp). Extended chords: major 7, minor 7, dominant 7, major 9, minor 9, add 9, sus2, sus4, 6\/9, diminished 7, half-diminished, augmented. Guitar anatomy and hardware: fretboard (not \"freight board\" or \"fret board\" as two words), frets (metal strips), strings (high E string, B string, G string, D string, A string, low E string), capo (not \"cape-o\"), tuning pegs (not \"tuning peggs\"), nut, bridge, saddle, soundhole, pickup (not \"pick up\" as two words), volume knob, tone knob, pickup selector switch, tremolo system, whammy bar, locking nut. Advanced guitar techniques: fingerpicking patterns (not \"finger picking\"), hybrid picking, sweep picking, economy picking, alternate picking, string skipping, palm muting, pinch harmonics, natural harmonics, artificial harmonics, hammer-on (not \"hammering\"), pull-off (not \"pulling off\"), string bending, pre-bend, bend and release, vibrato, wide vibrato, finger vibrato, wrist vibrato, sliding, legato, staccato, tapping, two-handed tapping. Scale systems: major scale (Ionian mode), natural minor scale (Aeolian mode), harmonic minor scale, melodic minor scale, pentatonic major scale, pentatonic minor scale, blues scale, chromatic scale, whole tone scale, diminished scale, bebop scale. Modal theory: Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor), Locrian. Chord theory and progressions: Roman numeral analysis (I-IV-V-I, ii-V-I, vi-IV-I-V, I-vi-ii-V), circle of fifths, secondary dominants, chord substitutions, tritone substitution, voice leading, inversions (first inversion, second inversion), slash chords.

Musical intervals with proper names: perfect unison, minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone (augmented fourth\/diminished fifth), perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, perfect octave.
