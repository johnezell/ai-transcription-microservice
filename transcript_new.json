I'm Muriel Anderson, welcome to 1-2-3 Fingerstyle Guitar. Maybe you've been playing guitar in other styles but are looking to get into fingerstyle. Or maybe you find that there's something missing in your playing, some level of solidity, some way of getting what's in here out to here, out to your hands and out into your music. Here's a way to get at that. Fingerstyle guitar allows you to do a completely different thing with your thumb and your finger. So you're getting a completely different sound, completely different melodies happening with a 2. And in order to develop that independence, we're going to start with just getting that thumb alternating and getting some real power and groove into that thumb. And that can transform your entire playing. People love to play and love to listen to fingerstyle guitar because you've got so much going on at the same time. You've got a melody going on with your fingers and a different melody and a different groove going on with your thumb. And so that's something that takes a while to develop and develop solidity in that. So have patience with yourself. If you've been playing for a while, it might feel like you're going back to kindergarten after being in college. But it will come, believe me. We're going to work through 19 sets of lessons, each covering an important aspect of fingerstyle guitar. For each set of lessons, you'll have three examples to work with. We'll work on getting the right motion of the thumb. We'll work on alternating bass consistently. We'll work on adding the fingers on the left hand, especially the pinky finger, accompanying songs. Keep that going and I'm going to mute the bass a little bit. Working in the blue note, just that pinky, a fret out to the fourth fret to grab that. Bunch of typical chord form. B7th shape. You're probably used to playing it here. Arpeggios. And even working the arpeggio together with a finger picking pattern. Bass runs. Walk-ups and walk-downs. Different turnarounds and endings in different keys. Hammer-ons and pull-offs. And of course, some cool licks. The beauty of this course is that you can use each of these techniques in the music that you already play or the music that you plan to learn. And I've also prepared several songs that are easy to play but sound cool and use the techniques that we've just learned. Each of the examples and the tunes have been transcribed for you in both notes and tab. And do check out the text that accompanies each lesson because there are some additional tips and ideas for you there. So are you ready? Let's get
